    <p>The history of&nbsp;<strong>Artel</strong>&nbsp;brand began in 2011, when it was decided to put into operation industrial sectors producing a family of home appliances under own trademark.</p>

<p>Establishment of a new business line is based on signing a strategic cooperation contract with recognized leaders in this field, namely: Samsung, South Korean brand, Midea, well-known Chinese company, Gloria, one of the best Italian manufacturers, and Odul, major Turkish producer.</p>

<p>It is a known fact that if you want to be in demand and strive to retain first place in the market, you need to constantly give out something new, original, attractive in form and outstanding with interesting content. Each employee of Artel possesses creative thinking, generates ideas, makes plans, and tries to turn them into reality.</p>

<p>The basic principle of&nbsp;<strong>Artel</strong>&nbsp;is manufacturing of high-quality, modern high-tech products for consumers who value comfort, simple solutions and classics of the genre. Stylish ergonomic design, certified raw materials and the most automated filling prove the image of Artel as the manufacturer of home appliances for people with good taste and high consumer demands.</p>

<p>Today&nbsp;<strong>Artel</strong>&nbsp;offers you the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Air conditioners;</li>
	<li>Vacuum cleaners;</li>
	<li>Microwave ovens;</li>
	<li>Gas, electric and combined stoves;</li>
	<li>Built-in kitchen appliances;</li>
	<li>Electric mini-ovens;</li>
	<li>TV sets;</li>
	<li>Washing machines;</li>
	<li>Refrigerators;</li>
	<li>Cellular phones;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Artel</strong>&nbsp;is a successful project; we managed to accumulate the positive experience of the partners and competitors, to introduce&nbsp;<span style="color:black">KAIZEN</span>&nbsp;method (its basic principles: economical work ethic and effective use of resources), to standardize the quality of products, to introduce a warranty system, to establish operation of own branded stores and showrooms throughout Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>The colors of our brand are white and bright green. Our choice is not accidental! Color spectrum, in other words, the rainbow unfolds on notes as follows: C-Red, D-Orange, E-Yellow, F-Green, G -Blue, A- Dark blue, B- Purple. Acting within the framework of this theory, it is easy to determine: the most advantageous perceived &ldquo;aurally&rdquo; and readable color is the one which falls under the definition of &ldquo;the golden mean&rdquo;, namely &ndash; green &ndash; the color of harmony, nature, freshness, peace of mind. White is good as well: it is neutral, absorbing the entire spectrum, symbolizing completeness of lines and emotions.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Artel</strong>&nbsp;is the home appliances which will quickly and easily manage with homework, will allow spending more time for yourself and your family. We strive to fill your life with unblighted happiness, sincere love and warm heart!</p>
